# Dailyprogrammer submissions

I had a bunch of these in a folder that I accidently deleted, so I figured I'd start pushing them to Github before I lose them again.

The filenames start with a letter that indicates the difficulty of the challenge, followed by its number. e stands for "easy", h for "hard" and i for "intermediate", so for instance, e221 translates to "Challenge #221 [Easy]". If the link isn't present inside the source, look it up on https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer in order to read its description. I'll start linking my submissions from now on.
